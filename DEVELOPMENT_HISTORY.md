magick icon_base.png -font DejaVu-Sans -pointsize 200 -fill white -annotate +180+320 '✨' assets/icon.png
```

### **Build Process Evolution**
```bash
# Initial multi-platform build
npm run build  # Generated 8 packages across platforms

# Optimization iterations
npm run clean
npm run build-deb  # Final optimized DEB-only build

dpkg-deb -I dist/EQPad-1.0.0-amd64.deb
```

### **Code Optimization Process**
```bash
# File cleanup iterations
rm script-enhanced.js  # Merged into optimized script.js
rm -f assets/icon.icns assets/icon.ico  # Removed empty icons
rm -rf dist/linux-unpacked  # Cleaned build artifacts
rm -rf node_modules  # Post-build cleanup
```
